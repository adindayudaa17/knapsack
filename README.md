# Knapsack 0/1
Welcome to the Knapsack 0/1 Solver project! This project is a Java-based GUI application that demonstrates two different algorithms (Brute Force and Dynamic Programming) for solving the 0/1 Knapsack problem. The application provides a graphical interface to input items with weights and profits and to calculate the optimal selection of items based on a weight constraint.

## Features
- Add/Remove Items: Easily add or remove items with specified weights and profits.
- Constraint Input: Input the maximum weight constraint for the knapsack.
- Algorithm Selection: Solve the knapsack problem using either Brute Force or Dynamic Programming.
- Results Display: View the selected items and the execution time of the algorithm.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- An IDE or text editor of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GozaRaid/knapsack01.git
cd knapsack01
```
2. **Build the Project**

   Open the project in your preferred IDE and build the project to resolve dependencies.

3. **Running the Application**

    In your IDE, locate the Main class (main/Main.java) and run it. This will launch the Knapsack 0/1 Solver application.

   **OR Via Terminal**
  ```bash
  cd knapsack01/src
  javac main/Main.java 
  javaÂ main/Main
  ```
